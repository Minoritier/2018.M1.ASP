## Course overview: 
Applied Stochastic Processes (ASP) is intended for the students who are
seeking advanced knowledge in stochastic calculus and are eventually interested in the jobs in
financial engineering. As the name indicates, the course will emphasis on applications such as
numerical calculation and programming. On completion of this course, the students will learn
how financial observations (e.g. stock prices and FX rate) are modelled with stochastic
processes and how they can be computed using analytics or computer simulations.

## Prerequisites: 
[Stochastic Finance](https://github.com/PHBS/2017.M3.StoFin) (FIN 519), a year 1 required course for quantitative finance program, is also highly recommended as it provides theoretical background. Undergraduate-level knowledge in probability, statistics, linear algebra and programming skill (Python) are highly recommended. The students without these recommended prerequisites are expected to take extra efforts.

##  Textbooks and Reading Materials
* Monte Carlo Methods in Finance by Peter Jaeckel
* Option Valuation Under Stochastic Volatility by Alan Lewis
* [Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/StochasticCalculus.html) by J. Michael Steele

## Assessment/Grading Details
Attendance 20%, Mid-term Exam 30%, Assignments 20%, Course Project 30%
* __Midterm exam__: 10.23 Tues. Open-book exam without computer/phone/calculator use. No final exam.
* __Course project__: Presentation (11.09 Fri). Group up to 2 people.
